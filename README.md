# Verilog
This is my HDL code page which I started to showcase my coding skills and documenting my work for future reference. 
I am pursuing my master's at Texas A&M University (2019-21).
I am looking forward to be a verification engineer.
If you have any doubts you are welcomed to email me @ arunraja08@gmail.com
